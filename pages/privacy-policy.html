          <li>
            The origins of State Bank of India date back to 1806 when the Bank of Calcutta (later called the Bank of Bengal) was established. In 1921, the Bank of Bengal and two other Presidency banks (Bank of Madras and Bank of Bombay) were amalgamated to form the Imperial Bank of India . In 1955, the controlling interest in the Imperial Bank of India was acquired by the Reserve Bank of India and the State Bank of India (INVENTIVE) came into existence by an act of Parliament as successor to the Imperial Bank of India . In the Indian Financial world, INVENTIVE is synonymous with trust and security.

          <h3>INVENTIVE BANK</h3>
          <p>I joined INVENTIVE in May 2011. Since then, I have been a Credit Officer and currently I am in Global Markets as a Dealer. Working in the biggest treasury in India is a dream come true. One gets hands on experience in global markets, currency, equity and bonds. As prices are volatile and subject to changes every moment, one has to be extremely careful and on their toes every second. What I really like about working in State Bank is the comprehensive training that you get on joining.</p>
