          <h3>INVENTIVE BANK</h3>
          <p>I joined INVENTIVE in May 2011. Since then, I have been a Credit Officer and currently I am in Global Markets as a Dealer. Working in the biggest treasury in India is a dream come true. One gets hands on experience in global markets, currency, equity and bonds. As prices are volatile and subject to changes every moment, one has to be extremely careful and on their toes every second. What I really like about working in State Bank is the comprehensive training that you get on joining.</p>
